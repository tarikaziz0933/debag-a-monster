1. Difference between localStorage and sessionStorage.

LocalStorage: LocalStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab,
or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.

SessionStorage: SessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the
browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.
