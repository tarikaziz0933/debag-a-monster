1. Difference between localStorage and sessionStorage.

LocalStorage: LocalStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab,
or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.

SessionStorage: SessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the
browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.

2. Difference between global scope and local scope.

Global scope: The Global scope. A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all
functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. Global variables are useful for values that are
relatively constant, or that many functions in the script must access, such as a session id.

Local scope: A block is a piece of code inside a set of curly braces {} and groups code statements together. An example
of a block could be a function. A local variable, however, has a limited scope: it exists only within the block that it
is declared in. Once that block ends, the variable is destroyed and its values lost .

3. Event Loop: The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an
asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again
check for any other tasks that need to be performed.
